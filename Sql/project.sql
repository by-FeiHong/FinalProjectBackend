The delay of VR applications is mainly composed of computing delay and communication delay. Although cloud computing centers have adequate computing power, accessing them requires long communication delay. Mobile edge computing (MEC), which offloads the computing power from the cloud computing center to the edge, is regarded as a feasible way to alleviate communication delay. However, due to the differences in the capability and location of MEC nodes, the selection of MEC nodes will affect both the computing delay and communication delay. In this project, we focus on the joint representation of computing and communication resources and the selection of the optimal MEC node. First, we adopt joint computing and communication resources (GCC) model for VR applications routing and formulate the VR routing problem. Then we design a algorithm which allows us to quickly obtain the optimal computing node and the path of shortest total delay.

For example, malicious users may disrupt data users by uploading illegal data, undermining the original order of the network, and causing security incidents. Additionally, data storage and usage are vulnerable to attacks, leading to severe consequences.

If the controller malfunctions or goes down, it can lead to the disconnection of switches. This attack propagation mechanism is similar to cascading failures in complex networks. For instance, in SDN, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on switches can overwhelm the network, causing a flood of malicious traffic that exhausts the resources of both the switches and the controller. This, in turn, can propagate through the network, leading to widespread disruption. In the context of complex networks, cascading failures are often classified based on their origin, propagation, and impact. Understanding these classifications helps in analyzing how failures spread within SDN environments. For example, a failure originating from a compromised switch can propagate through the control plane, affecting other switches and the overall network stability. Given the increasing prevalence of SDN, it is crucial to study the specific mechanisms by which cascading failures occur within these networks and to develop strategies to resist such failures.

However, their tendency to generate plausible but factually incorrect text, known as hallucination, remains a major challenge for researchers. To address this issue, this thesis investigates a framework called chain-of-knowledge (CoK, referring to https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/chain-of-knowledge) that enhances the factual accuracy of LLMs by dynamically incorporating background information from heterogeneous knowledge sources. The CoK framework primarily consists of three stages: reasoning preparation, dynamic knowledge adaptation, and answer consolidation.\n\nIn the reasoning preparation stage, CoK first utilizes few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate preliminary reasoning chains and identify relevant knowledge domains. Then, CoK employs self-consistency methods to determine whether external knowledge sources are necessary. In the dynamic knowledge adaptation stage, CoK adopts an adaptive query generator (AQG) to generate queries for various knowledge sources. The AQG can flexibly generate corresponding query languages based on the type of knowledge source, including SPARQL, SQL, and natural language sentences. CoK effectively reduces error propagation by retrieving and correcting knowledge for each step in the reasoning chain.

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has received considerable attention because of its potential to achieve superior spectral efficiency. Particularly, different from conventional multiple access (MA) techniques, NOMA uses the power domain to serve multiple users at different power levels in order to use spectrum more efficiently. Another approach to improve spectrum efficiency is the paradigm of underlay cognitive radio (CR) networks, which has rekindled increasing interest in using spectrum more efficiently. The key idea of underlay CR networks is that each secondary user (SU) is allowed to access the spectrum of the primary users (PUs) as long as the SU meets a certain interference threshold in the primary network (PN). By introducing the aforementioned two concepts, it is natural to consider the application of NOMA in underlay CR networks using additional power control at the secondary base station (BS) to improve the spectral efficiency. In this project, we consider the following: 1) All the SUs, primary transmitters (PTs), and primary receivers (PRs) are randomly deployed; 2) Each SU suffers interference from other NOMA SUs as well as the PTs; and 3) The secondary BS must satisfy a predefined power constraint threshold to avoid interference at the PRs. \n\nReferences: \n\n1) Zhiguo Ding, Yuanwei Liu, Jinho Choi, Qi Sun, Maged Elkashlan, Chih-Lin I, and H.

The key idea of NOMA is to realize multiple access (MA) in the power domain which is fundamentally different from conventional orthogonal MA technologies (e.g., time/frequency/code division MA). The motivation behind this approach lies in the fact that NOMA can use spectrum more efficiently by opportunistically exploring users’ channel conditions. Therefore, an important advantage of the NOMA concept is that it can squeeze a user with better channel conditions into the bandwidth channel that has been occupied by a user with poor channel conditions. For example, let\'s consider a practical scenario, in which there are two groups of users: 1) near users, which are close to the base station (BS) and have better channel conditions; and 2) far users, which are close to the edge of the cell controlled by the BS and therefore have poor channel conditions. This project considers simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in NOMA. The objective of this project is to design a new simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) NOMA protocol, in which near NOMA users that are close to the source act as energy harvesting relays to help far NOMA users. An interesting question arises: which near NOMA user is to help which far NOMA user. \n\nReferences: \n\n1) Zhiguo Ding, Yuanwei Liu, Jinho Choi, Qi Sun, Maged Elkashlan, Chih-Lin I, and H.

Due to the absence of source samples, traditional distribution matching approaches are no longer viable. The predominant alternative is self-supervised learning, which generates or mines auxiliary information to facilitate unsupervised adaptation. Two main approaches exist: constructing a pseudo-source domain to leverage established UDA methods such as adversarial learning or domain shift minimization based on distribution measurement and mining extra supervision from the source model or target data. In the presence of a domain distribution shift, applying the source model to the target domain introduces inevitable errors in pseudo-labeling or auxiliary supervision, thereby limiting adaptation performance. To address identified limitations, we pioneer the exploration of off-the-shelf multimodal foundation models, such as the vision-language (ViL) model CLIP, transcending the constraints of both the source model and target data knowledge. However, direct application of the ViL model proves unsatisfactory, lacking specialization for specific tasks. To overcome this, we propose a novel task-specific distillation approach. Initially, we customize the ViL model through unsupervised prompt learning for imposing task-specific information. Subsequently, we distill the knowledge from this customized ViL model to the target model, with joint supervision through two designed regularization terms: (1) most-likely category encouragement for coarse-grained distillation and (2) predictive consistency for fine-grained distillation.

In recent years, Network function virtualization (NFV) has been recognized as a promising technology. In NFV-enabled architectures, network business can be implemented through an ordered set of virtual network functions (VNFs) on standardized compute nodes, called service function chains (SFC). The application of this framework in UAV swarm network can realize the diversified mission driving in the region. However, the UAV swarm network has the characteristics of strong dynamic, frequent link interruption, and because of the limited resource capacity and computing resources of UAV equipment due to the SWAP problem, the implementation of such a framework faces many challenges. Most of the traditional deployment schemes use heuristic algorithms, and these mathematical planning and heuristic methods are optimized based on static network environment, which will cause problems such as convergence failure in the dynamic network environment of UAVs. Therefore, this paper designs and proposes an efficient dynamic deployment algorithm to make the network have high resource utilization, low network latency and reduce network congestion.

These works have in common the idea of perturbing the adjacency matrix and publishing a graph which has node/edge differential privacy so no nodes in the private target graph can be inferred from the published graph. However, this means the published graph is not a true synthetic graph as a high proportion is the non-perturbed adjacency matrix. The published graph is a hybrid, part anonymous graph and part newly added/deleted nodes/edges. This leaves open the possibility of reidentifcation of anonymised nodes through previously discussed techniques involving third-party data sources (this is a situation not covered by the guarantees of differential privacy). Methods include [3] where nodes/edges are randomly removed and added (this requires careful manual tuning) and basic parameters such as global clustering coefficient and degree distribution were not well replicated. PrivGraph [3] which breaks the graph into communities before perturbing the adjacency matrix and performs well on some measures but still has a high relative error on measures like modularity, clustering coefficient and graph diameter. \nYou will learn to use the Raphtory tool developed at QMUL [5][6] for reading and analysing graphs. \n\n[1] Frank McSherry and Talwar Kunal.

Consider a social network where a node is an individual and a link means they communicate with each other at a certain time. This can be thought of as a temporal network (a network that changes in time. One way of analysing social networks is through the idea of \"communities\", a technical term which groups the network into the sets of people who interact the most closely with each other. This can be done in many ways, for example using the concept of modularity [4]. A number of researchers have developed methods to find temporal communities [5][6][7]. Here, you will first read a real network and find communities as they change in time. Then you will develop a method, for example using the Stochastic Block Model, to create temporal communties. One such model is in [8].\n\n[1] B Steer et al.,  Raphtory: The temporal graph engine for Rust and Python.

Your first task is to read in three or four of the larger (and hence more important) languages on the database and create a temporal network that includes information about time, language and type of interaction (like, comment, post, share).

Because transactions need to be verifiable by everyone cryptocurrency networks (networks of transactions) can be inspected to look at the transactions being used. However, this is difficult because of the amount of data to be analysed. Temporal complex networks is a perfect tool to examine this system.

Powering such a device needs adequate capacity planning to determine the power supply (battery size) and any renewable energy generator (if used) versus power consumption.

Humans tend not to like the taste of underripe or overripe fruit.

Accurately classifying the ripeness of fruit requires experience. It may be unclear to a provider or customer if the fruit is ripe and ready to eat or if they need to wait some unknown time for the fruit to ripen.\nSome fruit such as bananas is easier to detect the ripeness because of well-known clear colour changes from green to yellow to brown. Other fruits such as apples can be more challenging to visually sense the ripeness because there are different variants with different colors, e.g., some are ripe red, some are ripe green.

It seeks to correlate the measurements of 2 or more different sensors and ascertain if 2 or more sensors have a better accuracy than one.

The motivation and benefits for using TinyML include: low latency of local computation for real time applications; reduced bandwidth costs from lower requirements for remote communication; reliability that persists even when network connectivity is lost; Improved security with fewer transmissions and local data storage. TinyML currently is only capable of using lightweight models to perform ML inferencing or classification on low resource edge devices but are unable to do any significant training there. The trained model needs to transformed to become smaller to be used for testing in-situ.\nThis project will focus on research and development of a human speech recognition application. The main benefits for using TinyML in that an edge device is more privacy preserving about what exactly our voice & what it’s used to do. Our voice is part of our biometric footprint used to secure access to key services such as banking. If our voice is too loosely shared with others, without being strongly encrypted, to access services, it could be cloned for unauthorised service access attacks.\nThere are many local voice recognition apps that could be investigated. First, is to aid language training of spoken Chinese for foreigners or non-natives. Here a Generative AI Neural Network (GAN) could be created to create variable pronunciation of a word, that is labelled (supervised learning) to see what’s the best match to help identify common learner Mandarin pronunciation mistakes [3] for a specific speaker. This is done via a frequency spectrum and time duration of word part sounds analysis. Second, key words could be recognised for apps such as voice commands.

To address these, edge and fog computing are becoming important as data analysis occurs closer to the device than a central cloud. There are several challenges in operating and managing IoT edge devices. With a growing number of connected IoT devices, it is not easy to manage data at virtual edge nodes, e.g.,. push updates sometimes can’t be sent because these IoT devices may sleep and / or disconnect if they are on low power networks. Moreover, edge devices are also heterogeneous in terms of hardware, languages, networks and operating systems. This also makes it all the more difficult to manage them remotely. \nIoT “containers” and “microservices” can help solve these challenges. IoT containers are extremely lightweight, self-sufficient software that can be securely deployed at a target platform in the edge.

The path loss is high at these frequencies. High gain antennas are required to maintain an acceptable link budget. Where mobility is required, the antennas must be capable of beam steering. Where they are available at all, the switches used to reconfigure antennas are extremely lossy at mm-wave frequencies, particularly when the switch is multi-throw.\n\nThe aim of this project is to scale a design for a 10 GHz switch which was developed at QMUL to operate at millimetre wave frequencies. The switch is based on substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology.
